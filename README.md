This projects uses YOLOv8 for object detection. The YOLOv8 model is a very capable object detection model. YOLOv8 is a computer vision model architecture developed by Ultralytics, the creators of YOLOv5. You can deploy YOLOv8 models on a wide range of devices, including NVIDIA Jetson, NVIDIA GPUs, and macOS systems with Roboflow Inference, an open source Python package for running vision models.
